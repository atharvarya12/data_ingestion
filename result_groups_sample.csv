Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator.

Shoe lift correction for leg length inequality: Lift therapy will be administered by a physical therapist. Heel lifts and full length inserts used inside participants' shoes will be constructed on-site. If an external shoe lift is required for a participant, a local shoe repair shop will construct the lifts and add them to the outside of the shoe. Participants will be required to wear the lift in their shoes when they are walking or standing while enrolled in the study; participants will keep a daily diary to record their compliance (number of hours lift worn per day, amount of lift used, type of shoes worn, general symptoms experienced, and activities performed). They will be contacted weekly to be reminded to increase their lift height and identify when they have achieved their optimal lift height.",

Doses of basal and bolus insulin and timing of bolus dose were individually adjusted and thus no maximum dose of insulin was specified. Basal rate insulin adjustment: The purpose of adjusting the basal rates was to ensure that BG was kept between 4.0-6.0 mmol/L \[71-108 mg/dL\] while in a fasting state and during the night. Bolus insulin titration: It was recommended that meal-time bolus insulin was titrated based on carbohydrate-counting using the Bolus Wizard® according to their usual practice and according to instructions from the investigator. Meal-time dosing was defined as bolus infusion initiated 0-2 minutes before a meal.,101028175.0
