101014845,NCT03675308,SECONDARY,Percentage of Participants With Resolution of Enthesitis at Week 24,"Resolution of enthesitis is defined as a Leeds Enthesitis Index (LEI) score = 0.

LEI is an enthesitis measure developed specifically for PsA and assesses the presence or absence of tenderness at the following 3 bilateral enthesial sites: medial femoral condyles, lateral epicondyles of the humerus, and Achilles tendon insertions. Tenderness on examination is recorded as either present (coded as 1), absent (coded as 0), or not assessed for each of the 6 sites. The LEI is calculated by taking the sum of the scores from the 6 sites. The LEI ranges from 0 to 6 (worst).

To increase the sample size due to the smaller number of participants with enthesitis at Baseline, the pre-specified analysis of the resolution of enthesitis included pooled data from KEEPsAKE 1 (this study) and the companion study KEEPsAKE 2 (M15-998; NCT03671148).",Week 24,Full analysis set participants with a Baseline LEI \> 0; Includes pooled data from KEEPsAKE 1 (this study) and the companion study M15-998 (NCT03671148; KEEPsAKE2).

LDI basic is a score based on finger circumference and tenderness, assessed across all digits. The LDI basic measures the ratio of the circumference of the affected digit to the circumference of the digit on the opposite hand or foot, using a minimum difference of 10% to define a dactylitic digit. The ratio of circumference is multiplied by a tenderness score (1 for tender, 0 for non-tender). If both sides of a digit are considered involved, or the circumference of the contralateral digit cannot be obtained, a standard reference table is used. Scores from each digit are summed to provide the final LDI. A higher LDI indicates worse dactylitis.

From these concepts, two summary component scores are derived: a Physical Component Summary (PCS) and a Mental Component Summary (MCS).

To calculate PCS, scales are standardized with a scoring algorithm or by the scoring software. Scores are standardized and range from 0 to 100, with a US population mean of 50 points and a SD of 10 points. The PCS and the MCS have been demonstrated to have excellent psychometric properties.
