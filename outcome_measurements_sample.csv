The Haemo-Qol-A questionnaire is a fit for purpose hemophilia-specific health related quality of life (HRQoL) questionnaire for adults consisting of 41 items covering six domains (Physical Functioning, Role Functioning, Worry, Consequences of Bleeding, Emotional Impact and Treatment Concerns).The Haemo-Qol-A items are answered on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time). The recall period for the Haemo-Qol-A is one month (4-weeks).

The Haemo-Qol-A role functioning domain score is an average of each item value within a domain. The range of domain scores is 0 to 5; higher scores mean better HRQoL or less impairment for the domain. The role functioning domain score is transformed to a 0 (minimum) to 100 (maximum) scale with higher scores indicating a better or less impaired haemophilia-related role functioning.",Score on a scale,MEAN,6.03,6.03,Standard Deviation,10.29,10.29,,,,,

It is a generic measure, as opposed to one that targets a specific age, disease, or treatment group.

For each of the domains and scores that the SF36 measures an aggregate percentage score is produced. The percentage scores range from 0% (lowest or worst possible level of functioning) to 100% (highest or best possible level of functioning).
